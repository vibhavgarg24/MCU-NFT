Setup local tooling:
Make directory
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat

Get sample project working:
npx hardhat
npm install --save-dev "hardhat@^2.8.0" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle@^2.0.0" "ethereum-waffle@^3.0.0" "chai@^4.2.0" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@^2.0.0" "ethers@^5.0.0"
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js

Write our starter contract:
Delete the file sample-test.js under test.  Also, delete sample-script.js under scripts. Then, delete Greeter.sol under contracts. Don't delete the actual folders!
Create your contract (a file name.sol) under the contracts directory
Go into the scripts directory and make a file named run.js. This is what run.js is going to have inside it:

	const main = async () => {
  	const nftContractFactory = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory('MyEpicNFT');
  	const nftContract = await nftContractFactory.deploy();
  	await nftContract.deployed();
  	console.log("Contract deployed to:", nftContract.address);
	};

	const runMain = async () => {
  	try {
    	await main();
    	process.exit(0);
  	} catch (error) {
    	console.log(error);
    	process.exit(1);
  	}
	};

	runMain();

Before you run this, be sure to change solidity: "0.8.4", to solidity: "0.8.0", in your hardhat.config.js
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
